			<p>I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.</p>

							<p>Lula's been my dog for two years, and she's really fun to play with. I like to take her to the park. Her favorite toy is an old tennis ball.</p>

							<p>Slowpoke is my turtle.  I have had him for as long as I can remember, but he became mine for real when I turned 10 because I promised to take care of him.</p>
						</td>
						<td>
							<p>Hamster is the name of my fish.  I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him anyway.  He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.</p>
